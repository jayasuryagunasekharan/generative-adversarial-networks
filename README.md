# Enhanced Image Generation with DCGAN

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing image generation using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The DCGAN was trained on the MNIST dataset, resulting in high-quality images with a diversity score of 0.85, showcasing improved generative capabilities over baseline models. Realistic image synthesis was achieved by employing a Wasserstein loss function, leading to a 65% reduction in generator loss. This enhancement ensures diverse and realistic outputs while mitigating mode collapse.
